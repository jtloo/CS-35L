First, I checked to make sure that openssh-server and openssh-client
was installed. To do this, I used the command:

dpkg —-get-selections | grep openssh

This returned:
openssh-client	install

Thus, to install openssh-server, I used:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Now using
dpkg —-get-selections | grep openssh

returns
openssh-client		install
openssh-server			install
openssh-sftp-server		install

Being the Client:
To generate my public and private keys, I used:
ssh-keygen

This prompted me to enter a file in which to save the key in
/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa. I named the file authorized_key.
The passphrase was Aloha.

After, it outputted your identification has been saved in
authorized_key and the public key is saved in authorized_key.pub.
I then copied my public key to the server using:
ssh-copy-id -i authorized_key justin@10.97.85.72

I forgot to initially put the file name and it did not work.
I then put:
ssh-add authorized_key
to add my private key to the authentication agent, so I will not
have to type in my password.

Now I can log in without a password using
ssh justin@10.97.85.97

I also used:
ssh -X justin@10.97.85.97

and I was able to open FireFox.

Being the Host:
I created the account using 
sudo useradd -d /home/comran -m comran
sudo passwd comran

The password was 1234.

I created the .ssh directory by:
cd /home/comran
sudo mkdir .ssh

I changed the ownership and permission for it
sudo chown -R Yanick .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I then disabled password-based authentication by
emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config

However, I needed to install it first.
sudo apt-get install emacs

When I opened it, I could not edit the file, so I tried
sudo emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config

and it worked.

To give Comran his IP Address, I used the command
hostname -I

which output: 10.97.85.46
