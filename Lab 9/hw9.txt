Step 2:
cd diffutilsHW
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

Step 3:
To install my patch file quote-3.0-patch.txt I used
patch -p1 < ../../quote-3.0-patch.txt 

I saved the patch file in the directory Assignment9 that houses
all the Assignment 9 items.

This output:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

Step 4 and 5:
I opened Emacs and used
C-x 4 a 
to create a ChangeLog. The text of the ChangeLog is seen below.

2017-06-01  Justin Tyler Loo  <loo@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>

        * src/cmp.c: Replaced the ` character with '
        * src/diff.c: Replaced the ` character with '
        * src/diff3.c: Replaced the ` character with '
        * src/dir.c: Replaced the ` character with '
        * src/sdiff.c: Replaced	the ` character	with '
        * src/util.c: Replaced the ` character with '

Step 6:
To commit my changes and ChangeLog to the new branch, I used
git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

To check that everything worked, I used:
git log

This output:
commit 6977ef2809fba91f1d3d385c5e6319a9544ef3b3
Author: Justin Tyler Loo <loo@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>
Date:   Thu Jun 1 14:19:24 2017 -0700

    2017-06-01  Justin Tyler Loo  <loo@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>
    
        * src/cmp.c: Replaced the ` character with '
        * src/diff.c: Replaced the ` character with '
        * src/diff3.c: Replaced the ` character with '
        * src/dir.c: Replaced the ` character with '
        * src/sdiff.c: Replaced the ` character with '
        * src/util.c: Replaced the ` character with '

Step 7:
To generate a patch file, I used
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

The -1 is so that only my commit is used in the patch file.

Step 8:
My partner is Comran Morshed. To verify his patch, I first checked
out v3.0 of Diffutils into a branch named partner.
git checkout v3.0 -b partner

I then copied his formatted patch file into my Assignment9 directory
I created to house all the Assignment 9 files. 
I ran:
git am < ../../Comran-formatted-patch.txt

which output
Applying: 2017-06-03 Comran Anthony Morshed <comran@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

I then built the program using:
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make clean

To test to make sure it worked, I ran
./src/diff -

and the error message was
./src/diff: missing operand after '-'

which is correct.

Step 9:
To check if my ChangeLog entry worked, I ran
git checkout quote
make distdir
cd diffutils*

The cd command took me to the diffutils-3.0.1-6e14 directory.
I then opened the ChangeLog using:
emacs ChangeLog

I looked at the ChangeLog and the first entry was:
2017-06-01  Justin Tyler Loo  <loo@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>

        2017-06-01  Justin Tyler Loo  <loo@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>
                * src/cmp.c: Replaced the ` character with '
                * src/diff.c: Replaced the ` character with '
                * src/diff3.c: Replaced the ` character with '
                * src/dir.c: Replaced the ` character with '
                * src/sdiff.c: Replaced the ` character with '
                * src/util.c: Replaced the ` character with '

This was what I used for my ChangeLog when committing.

Step 10:
I ran 
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

I ran into the error 
Application initialization failed: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
Error in startup script: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
    while executing
"load /usr/lib64/tk8.5/../libtk8.5.so Tk"
    ("package ifneeded Tk 8.5.7" script)
    invoked from within
"package require Tk"
    (file "/usr/local/cs/bin/gitk" line 10)
