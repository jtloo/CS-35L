1. Brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because
it was listed twice, one after the other. It was unecessary to that
because he also deleted the line "goto case_long_iso_time_style". This
prevents it from being called, so even if "case_long_iso_time_style:"
was not deleted, it would not be called.

2. The patch may cause problems in countries that don't speak English or
don't understand English-format dates because the patch specifically
changes the date format to the English format. This would cause people
from those countries to not be able to understand it. This would also
adversely affect other programs that use a different date format. Those
programs would not be able to interpret the patch's date format.

3. When running the randline.py script on the empty file /dev/null/ ,
it outputted IndexError: list index out of range. This error is due to
the script trying to access an index of an empty list. Any attempt to access
any part of that list would fail because it does not exist.
