INSTALLING COREUTILS:
To download Coreutils, I used the command:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

I unzipped it by using the command:
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Installing Coreutils:
I first went into the new coreutils-7.6 directory using
cd ./coreutils-7.6 . I then used cat INSTALL to read the installation
directions for it. I also used mkdir coreutilsInstall to make a directory
in my home directory in which I could install Coreutils in.
Looking inside the INSTALL file I found that to install the program into
the coreutilsInstall directory I had to use the command
./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/loo/coreutilsInstall/
The prefix flag was necessary because the default installat
I then ran the make command to compile it and then make install
to install it.

Reproducing the Bug:
I first checked to the locale of the system to ensure that the
locale was en_US.UTF-8, and the locale command showed me that
it was. To reproduce the bug, I first used the default ls command
in Linux. This was wrong though because Linux used the ls command
that was located in /bin/ls. To use the Coreutils version, I first
tried to use ./ls , but there was no ls file in the base directory
of coreutilsInstall. Thus, I ran find -name ls to find the ls file.
It was in the bin folder so I used : cd ./bin. Then, I was able to 
run the ./ls -l command to reproduce the error.

Creating the Patch:
I created a file called patch_file and copied the patch into it. I
first tried patch -p0 < patch_file , but I realized there was not
a directory named a inside the coreulis-7.6 directory. I realized
I needed to make the pnum be p1 to get rid of the a before the / in
a/src/ls.c and the b in b/src/ls.c. The code now is
patch -p1 < patch_file
I then ran the make command to recompile the ls.c file.

Testing the Fix:
I used this file lab3.txt to test the fix on a recently modified file.
For the modified ls command I went into the directory
/u/ee/ugrad/loo/coreutils-7.6/src and ran the command
./ls -l ~/Assignment3/lab3.txt
This gave the same output had I run the default Linux
ls command.
-rw-r--r-- 1 loo eeugrad 1814 Apr 18 15:31 /u/ee/ugrad/loo/Assignment3/lab3.txt

For the unmodified ls command, I went into the directory where
I installed Coreutils and where the ls command was located:
/u/ee/ugrad/loo/coreutilsInstall/bin
I again ran the command: ./ls -l ~/Assignment3/lab3.txt
This output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 loo eeugrad 1814 2017-04-18 15:31 /u/ee/ugrad/loo/Assignment3/lab3.txt
The formatting of the date is wrong.

To test the two ls files on a file that is at least 1 year old, I
created a file using: touch â€“t 201401210959.30 test_file 
The modified ls file output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 loo eeugrad 0 Apr 18 15:40 /u/ee/ugrad/loo/Assignment3/test_file
which matches the default ls output.
The unmodified ls file output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 loo eeugrad 0 2017-04-18 15:40 /u/ee/ugrad/loo/Assignment3/test_file
which does not match.
