Laboratory 1: Linux and Emacs Scavenger Hunt

1. You type in man -k followed by the word that that you want to search for. 
For example, if you want to find list you would do man -k list.
I got this answer by first using the hint of typing in man man, then 

2. The cp command is located at /bin/cp and 
the wc command is located at /usr/bin/wc
These were found using the hint which. I used man which to find out 
how to use the command and saw the example section where is says to 
put which followed by the command you want to search for.

3. Using the hint of the find command and using man find to 
figure out how to use it, I used the command find /usr/bin -name ‘?’
to find the executable programs with names that are one character
long. I then used man followed by the program name to
figure out what they do.
Programs:
w - shows the users who are currently logged on and what they are doing
[ - There is no man entry of this.
X - It is a network transparent window system which runs on a wide 
    range of computing and graphics machines.

4. When executing the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs,
the file that is actually executed is /etc/alternatives/emacs. 
This was found using the command readlink /usr/bin/emacs

5. The symbolic mode g+s means that the other users in the file’s 
group can set user or group ID on execution.
o-x means that other users not in the file’s group
no longer can execute the file. This was found using man chmod.

6. To find a file that was modified three weeks ago, use the 
command find -mtime -21. This was found using the man page for find.

7. To find a directory that was modified three weeks 
ago, use the command find -mtime -21 -type d.

8. To find the number of symbolic links I used find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l
354 symbolic links

9. To find the oldest regular file, use the command 
find /usr/lib/ -type f -printf "\n%TD %p" | sort -k1.7nr  -k1.8nr -k1.1nr -k1
The oldest regular file is: 
/usr/lib/x86_64-redhat-linux5E/include/bits/stdio-lock.h

10. Using the man locale command, the locale command gets its data from the
LC_* environment variables. These variables are created by localedef.

11. To find the commands with sort in their name, I used C-h a sort
Buffer-menu-sort
Buffer-menu-sort-by-column
ibuffer-invert-sorting
ibuffer-toggle-sorting-mode
rmail-sort-by-author
rmail-sort-by-correspondent
rmail-sort-by-date
rmail-sort-by-labels
rmail-sort-by-lines
rmail-sort-by-recipient
rmail-sort-by-subject
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields

12. C-M-a It moves the cursor to the start of the function.
C-M-b It moves the cursor backwards over a sexp.
C-M-c It exits a recursive edit.
C-M-d It moves the cursor down a list structure.
C-M-e It moves the cursor to the end of the function.
C-M-f It moves the cursor forwards over a sexp.
C-M-g It is like C-g. It quits the current command.
C-M-h It marks the function.

13. C-g aborts the partially typed or executing command.

14. The Emacs function yank reinserts the last stretch of killed text.

15. The difference between the output of the ls -l command 
and the directory listing the dired command is that the dired command 
lists all the files in the directory, including those files that 
have . at the beginning of their name. The output of ls -l does not show
the files whose names have . at the beginning. Also, the dired 
output has total used in directory written at the top 
while the ls -l output does not.
